    "text": "fix: Fixes destructuring signal with await bug\nFixes #9686 and #9312 and #9982. Because I can't find a place to determine if an expression is asynchronous, and I can't find a builder for async/await, I ended up building it. Hopefully it's good enough, but comments and feedback and advice is most certainly welcome, because I could be wrong :)\r\n\r\n## Svelte 5 rewrite\r\n\r\nPlease note that [the Svelte codebase is currently being rewritten for Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes). Changes should target Svelte 5, which lives on the default branch (`main`).\r\n\r\nIf your PR concerns Svelte 4 (including updates to [svelte.dev.docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)), please ensure the base branch is `svelte-4` and not `main`.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] Prefix your PR title with `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `docs:`.\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests and linting\r\n\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint`"
