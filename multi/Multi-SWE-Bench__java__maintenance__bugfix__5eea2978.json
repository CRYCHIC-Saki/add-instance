    "type": "issue",
    "text": "Fix #1015: JsonFactory always respects `CANONICALIZE_FIELD_NAMES`\nPreviously a subset of methods did not check for\r\n`CANONICALIZE_FIELD_NAMES` in the factory features configuration.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate an opinion on whether or not you'd prefer an update to `UTF8StreamJsonParser` to support a non-canonicalizing ByteQuadsCanonicalizer. Currently we don't use this parser with a non-canonicalizing parser because it underperforms on large input and I don't have any intention of changing that, however it may be a footgun to fail if that ever changes in a refactor. Failure would likely cause us to re-discover that the reader-based implementation is a better fit when canonicalization is disabled in the new path which is a plus, but potential instability in the interim wouldn't be ideal. I've left the class as is for now, keeping this change as minimal as possible."
