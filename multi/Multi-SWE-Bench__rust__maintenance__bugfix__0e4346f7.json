Now, we scope each\r\n`flatten` to not do that.\r\n\r\nI had originally intended to bake this into the initial / final methods\r\nbut that would have required some re-work to allow capturing state\r\nbetween them that seemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFixes #2803\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your PR closes some issues, please write `Closes #XXXX`\r\nwhere `XXXX` is the number of the issue you want to fix.\r\nEach issue goes on its own line.\r\n-->"
