    "text": "fix: error on duplicate style and class directive\n## Svelte 5 rewrite\r\n\r\nCloses #13095\r\n\r\nI've also left a comment about the rest of the directives since i fell in the trap of try to add those tho only to discover they were already handled.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: linting fortunately caught something i didn't realised could've been a problem. Something like this\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<div draggable={true} class:draggable={true} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould actually be allowed, so i've fixed this bug...~i've slightly modified the test runner to assert that a code should not produce compiler errors so that i was able to also test for this. Let me know if it's not what we want, i can move the test in another suite but it seemed something that could be useful.~ scratch that, after a chat with Simon i moved the test to `validator` and reverted the changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that [the Svelte codebase is currently being rewritten for Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes). Changes should target Svelte 5, which lives on the default branch (`main`).\r\n\r\nIf your PR concerns Svelte 4 (including updates to [svelte.dev.docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)), please ensure the base branch is `svelte-4` and not `main`.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] Prefix your PR title with `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `docs:`.\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests and linting\r\n\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint`"
