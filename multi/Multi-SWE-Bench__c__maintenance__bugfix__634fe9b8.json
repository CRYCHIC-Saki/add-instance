    "type": "issue",
    "text": "Fix extracting docstring from constructors\nfrom classes or actors with initialized fields\r\n\r\nby executing `sugar_docstring` on the constructors before adding the initializers. This will actually execute `sugar_docstring` twice on such constructors, but as it is idempotent, there is no danger here.\r\n\r\nThe docstrings have been inlined into the constructor body before.\r\n\r\nNow they will show up correctly in the generated docs.\r\n\r\nFixes #2582"
