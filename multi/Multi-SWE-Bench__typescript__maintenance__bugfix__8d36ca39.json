However, the highlighting of the button was based on onMouseDown and onMouseUp. Since onMouseUp is triggered before onClick, there was a moment of time between the onMouseUp and onClick events which created the flicker. I solved this by updating the state of the component during the onMouseDown event. This does slightly change the functionality of the component, I'm not sure if this is an ok change or not, please lmk!\r\n\r\nCloses #37673 \r\n\r\n![Recording 2023-07-06 at 19 08 22](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/assets/42901020/b52533e2-155e-4da8-b912-4ec04d7722dd)"
